# Module 16 Challenge

## Amazon Web Services 

### Overview

*Background*

BigMarket is a startup that helps companies optimize their marketing efforts. An account manager at BigMarket, Jennifer, is working on a project for a client, Sellby. Sellby is a retail website and is working on a hefty project: releasing a new catalog of products. Before they release these new products, they would like to have reviews of their products compared with product reviews from their competitors. Sellby would also like to know if it is worth the cost to gift free products to select reviewers. Since the data has exceeded the capacity of operational databases, it is now considered "big data"; therefore, the data will need to be translated and edited to make the data into a meaningful guide to the client, Sellby. 

*Purpose*

Since the work with Jennifer on the SellBy project was successful, another, larger project has been assigned. Now we will be analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

This project will utilize approximately 50 datasets. Each one contains reviews of a specific product, from clothing apparel to wireless products. One of the datasets will be chosen, and PySpark will be used to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, PySpark, Pandas, or SQL will be used to determin potential bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset. Then, a summary will contain the analysis for Jennifer to submit to the SellBy stakeholders.
